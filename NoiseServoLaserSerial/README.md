This is an app I made to send random points to an Arduino via serial. The goal is to control two servos with the random points generated. The points are generated with `ofNoise()`. Eventually, I'd like to migrate this over to a Raspberry Pi and run the everything off that so the whole thing is small, clean, and portable.
